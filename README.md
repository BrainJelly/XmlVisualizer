# XmlVisualizer
This is a fork of the [XmlVisualizer.v2](http://xmlvisualizer.codeplex.com/) by  Lars Hove Christiansen.

### Notable differences
- Supports XML Namespaces in resolving XPath expressions.
- Release build calls the ILMerge.exe located in the ILMerge NuGet package to merge into a single executable.
